There are 4 access modifier in java
    -public
    -default
    -protected
    -private

    *Variables-Constructor-methods

    **public**
    The access level is everywhere
    What does it mean everywhere?
        -current class-outside the current class within package-outsize package


    **default**
    The access level is only withing package
    if we do not type any access modifier,it will be default.


    **protected**
    if there is not any relation between classes, protected access modifier is like default.
    But there is parent-child relation between classes,
    child class can reach parent class, even if Ä±t is outside the package(for data member and methods)


    **private**
    The access level is only within the class.
    It cannot reach from outside the class.



    **private constructor role**
    you cannot create the instance out of class.


    **method overloading**
    not be more restrictive overriding method in child class


    **local variables**
    dont have acces modifier.
